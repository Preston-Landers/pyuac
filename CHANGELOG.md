# Changes

## 0.0.1

 - Initial package release based on a cleaned up version of my Gist originally published here:
 
    https://gist.github.com/Preston-Landers/267391562bc96959eb41

 Compared to the original version of the Gist, this new version:
 
  * Has been updated for modern Python 3 (and 2.7)
  
  * Correctly handles complex script command lines, e.g. quoted spaces in parameters.
  
  * Provides a decorator for your script's main function for easier usage.

  * It has some basic tests.
